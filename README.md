# AndroidKeylogger
This is a step to demonstrate how we can create  own keyboard and access its keystoke in android.
Android devices come with system keyboard or google keyboard with their default setting, and we  can not access its keystoke.
So simpley we can make our own soft keypad and install it and set it as default keypad from android setting.


In This project InputMethodService class of android is used and implemented keyboard action listener. 
Added a back service class which takes the keystoke and save in txt file in device memory, when file size cross a specific limit Gmail sender 
class send the file to specific email id.
